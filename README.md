### Hi, I'm Jared ðŸ‘‹

I am a recent California State University Fullerton graduate with Bachelors of Computer Science and an emphasis on software engineering.
I was also the junior developer on the [Tuffix Project](https://github.com/CSUF-Tuffix/Tuffix-2), a Linux development environment used at CSUF.
I love to tackle new and exciting problems.

Checkout my [website](https://www.jareddyreson.xyz) for live demos of applications I have made.
